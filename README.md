Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition (Real-Time Air Drawing)

This project demonstrates a real-time handwritten digit recognition system using a webcam. It tracks your index finger in the air (via MediaPipe), draws the path onto a virtual canvas, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the drawn digit.
